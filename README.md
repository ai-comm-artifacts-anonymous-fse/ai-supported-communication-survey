# AI-Supported Communication Survey (Anonymous Artifact)

This repository contains the survey instrument used in an exploratory study examining how AI-supported tools influence communication, collaboration, and shared understanding in software development teams.

The materials are provided to support transparency and reproducibility for an anonymous submission to the FSE 2026 Industry, Vision, and Reflection (IVR) track.

## Overview

The survey was designed to capture developers’ and graduate students’ perceptions of:
- Communication challenges in collaborative software development
- The perceived role of AI in team communication
- Trade-offs between efficiency and shared understanding
- Privacy and security concerns related to AI-supported communication
- Readiness to adopt AI tools in team workflows

The instrument includes a combination of Likert-scale and categorical questions and was administered online.

## Survey Instrument

- **Respondents:** Developers and graduate students with experience in collaborative software development
- **Sample size:** 34 valid responses

The survey questions are organized into constructs that align with the analysis presented in the paper, including:
- Communication challenges
- AI role perception (assistant vs. teammate)
- AI impact on communication
- Privacy and security
- Adoption readiness

## Use in the Paper

Results from this survey are analyzed using descriptive statistics to identify recurring patterns rather than statistically significant effects. The survey findings are triangulated with public discourse mined from Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Reddit to examine how similar concerns appear in naturally occurring developer discussions.
